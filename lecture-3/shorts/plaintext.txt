A plaintext example is any unformatted text, such as a simple email or a basic ".txt" file, that contains only characters readable by humans or machines, without any formatting like bolding, italics, or different fonts. For example, a file containing "Hello, world!" with no attached special formatting or metadata is a plaintext file, but a JPG image or a Word document containing that same text is a binary file because it includes additional data.
